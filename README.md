## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze the performance of IPOs issued between 2010 and 2023. By examining various factors such as listing gains, current gains, sector-wise analysis, and market comparisons, we aim to provide valuable insights for potential investors.

## Data

The analysis is based on a dataset that includes information on IPOs, such as the IPO name, sector, issue size, subscription levels, listing gains, current gains, and more. The IPO dataset is sourced from MoneyControl and NSE data for sane period is downloaded from Yahoon Finance.

## Analysis

The analysis involves several key aspects:

- Listing Gains: Examining the percentage change in stock prices from the listing open to the listing close.
- Current Gains: Analyzing the percentage change in stock prices from the listing open to the current market price.
- Sector-wise Analysis: Exploring the performance of IPOs across different sectors.
- Market Comparison: Comparing the performance of IPOs with market indices, such as Nifty, to assess relative performance.
- Oversubscription Analysis: Investigating the relationship between oversubscription categories (QIB, HNI, RII) and performance.
- Seasonality Analysis: Identifying any patterns or seasonality aspects in terms of IPO issuance and performance.

## Key Findings

Based on the analysis, the following key findings have been observed:

- Certain sectors, such as IT and Metals & Mining, have shown significant outperformance compared to the market index.
- Oversubscription, particularly in the QIB category, tends to correlate with better post-IPO performance.
- Seasonality analysis reveals specific months or quarters that yield higher IPO issuance, indicating potential patterns in the market.

## Usage

To replicate or further explore the analysis, you can follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository. The notebook includes the necessary code and instructions for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
